# 🧌 HashGremlin

**Have you ever wanted a pet gremlin with a cryptocurrency trading addiction?**

---

## 🧙‍♂️ So uhh... wtf is this?

HashGremlin is a reinforcement learning Bitcoin trading bot, built for:

* **Infinite Training Loops** → never stop, always adapt.
* **Checkpointing & Resume** → close, reopen, and pick up exactly where you left off.
* **PPO + GAE Stability** → no toy models here, this is real reinforcement learning.
* **Vectorized Environments** → multiple gremlins in parallel, fighting over who learns faster.
* **Risk-Aware Metrics** → Sharpe ratio, drawdown, survival rates.

---

## ⚡ Features

* Rich CLI with **ASCII art**
* GPU acceleration (CUDA ready)
* Smart checkpointing (best-by-Sharpe model saving)
* “Hive mode” (planned): gremlins can sync knowledge and share wins

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lolitemaultes/hashgremlin.git
cd hashgremlin

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# now train your army of gremlins
python hashgremlin.py
```

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* PyTorch 2.6+
* CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
* A tolerance for chaos

---

## 🧩 Philosophy

I made HashGremlin to experiment in:

* Letting agents learn by fighting the market directly
* Rewarding survival over blind gambling
* Turning financial capitalism into an AI training ground

Who needs lonely crypto bots that don't even work, when you've got an army of gremlins?
